### Day 2: August 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: wait for some html load, navigate to video page based on course link

**Thoughts:** I had some problems with async functions because I wasn't finding a way to stop the execution until some HTML element render, but reading the documentation I find 'page.waitForSelector()' that was exactly what I needed

### Day 3: August 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: intalled husky, commitlint and commitizen and refactored some code

**Thoughts:** searching for a pattern for my commits messages I found conventional commits. Then I installed commitizen for a more intuitive way of write my commits and commitizen to make sure that I am not out of the convention. I hope both tools make my life easier when writing a commit.

### Day 4: August 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: studied how to get responses and how handle multiple pages

**Thoughts:** learned how to get json and other response from a page, it seems to be really efective to handle with data from some page.

### Day 5: August 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: changed puppeteer to puppeteer-core, read user-info from json.

**Thoughts:** added a chromium with mp4 support because default chromium don't load any h264 midia, then changed puppeteer to puppeteer-core, I also done made changes on source of user informations and some refactor.

### Day 6: August 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: save files, implemented a function that save .mp4 videos in my app, using node-fetch and fs, made some changes on husky hooks too.

**Thoughts:** After the implementation of save videos I think most of this project is done and in the next days I'll finish it, I think i've been very productive in the last days. After all, there are some big changes I need to do, but everything gonna be okay :)

### Day 7: August 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: save mp4 and json, create directories and lots of fixes and refactor.

**Thoughts:** Most of the time today, I fixxed some problems that remained from yesterday. Now if run the code, I can check if there is a new video and download it, but I'm still having some issues with download chat.
