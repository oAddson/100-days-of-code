### Day 2: August 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: wait for some html load, navigate to video page based on course link

**Thoughts:** I had some problems with async functions because I wasn't finding a way to stop the execution until some HTML element render, but reading the documentation I find 'page.waitForSelector()' that was exactly what I needed

### Day 3: August 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: intalled husky, commitlint and commitizen and refactored some code

**Thoughts:** searching for a pattern for my commits messages I found conventional commits. Then I installed commitizen for a more intuitive way of write my commits and commitizen to make sure that I am not out of the convention. I hope both tools make my life easier when writing a commit.
