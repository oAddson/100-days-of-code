### Day 2: August 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: wait for some html load, navigate to video page based on course link

**Thoughts:** I had some problems with async functions because I wasn't finding a way to stop the execution until some HTML element render, but reading the documentation I find 'page.waitForSelector()' that was exactly what I needed
